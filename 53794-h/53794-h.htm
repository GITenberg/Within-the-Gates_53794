<div class="blockquot"><p>A library in a city house. A dining-room opens beyond a portière.
The dinner-table is set. The library is furnished in red leather
and dark wood. Books run to the ceiling. The carpet is
indeterminate in tone. The heavy curtains are of a rich, dark
crimson. A window is to be seen. The library is littered a little
with the signs of feminine occupation. At one of the tables sits
Mrs. Thorne. She is a young and beautiful woman, of stately
presence and modest, high-bred manner. She is well-dressed&mdash;but not
over-dressed&mdash;in a tea-gown such as a lady might wear in her own
home when guests are not expected. The dress is cream-white; it
falls open over a crimson skirt. The lamps are shaded with lace of
red or of white. One with a white shade is on the table by which
she sits. Her sewing materials are lying about, among books and
magazines half-cut. She tries to sew upon a little boy’s lace
collar, but throws her work down restlessly. Her face wears a
troubled expression.</p></div>

<p>(<i>She rises and crosses the room nervously; goes to the window, and
stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a>{2}</span> between the long lace curtains, looking out. She consults her
watch; speaks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> It is not so very late! Hardly past six o’clock yet. What
can be the matter with me? I must not become a worrier. A doctor’s wife
can never afford to be that.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie.</span> Shall I serve dinner, ma’am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> The Doctor has not come, Maggie. We must wait&mdash;Jane will be
careful not to burn the soup.</p>

<p>(<i>Rises and looks again restlessly out of the window; calls</i>:)</p>

<p>Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie.</span> Ma’am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> When you went up to light the Doctor’s candles, how did
Laddie seem? Did Molly say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie.</span> Just the same, she said. He does seem sort of miser’ble.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> (<i>takes up a magazine and tries, in vain, to read; sighs,
and lays it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a>{3}</span> down; takes up the little lace collar and tries to sew;
lays that down; rises</i>). I’ll run up again and look at the child for
myself.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie.</span> Mrs. Fayth, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>pale, sweet-faced, delicate, with the languorous
step of the half-cured invalid. She is in carriage dress, with a long,
dove-colored opera cape&mdash;rich, but plain in design. She throws off the
cape at once</i>).</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>warmly embracing her friend</i>). Why, Mary Fayth! <i>You?</i> At
this time of night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> Yes. I&mdash;Mary Fayth&mdash;isn’t it wonderful? I haven’t been out
after sundown before for six years.... Is the Doctor in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> He hasn’t come yet. I am waiting for him. We never can
tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> Doesn’t the dinner get cold?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> The dinner is subject to chronic bronchitis and acute
pneumonia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> (<i>laughs merrily</i>). Acute pneu-mo-nia is good.... You were
always clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> But I don’t fret. A doctor’s wife can never do that....
Give me your cape, dear. You’ll wait for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> I did want to surprise him. He would be so pleased. My
husband calls me Doctor Thorne’s miracle. But never mind. I can’t wait
for him. I’m on my way to the Hospital Fair.... Think of that! I’m to be
let stay till half-past eight o’clock. Fred is to meet me there, and
we’re to dine at the café with the crowd and see the tableaux.... Think
of it!&mdash;like common, vulgar, healthy people. Isn’t it wonderful? To be
half alive! I have been half dead so long! Kiss me, Helen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). I hope you won’t pay for it to-morrow, dear.
(<i>Kisses her affectionately.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>cheerily</i>). Oh, I expect to be flat to-morrow. But it’s
worth it&mdash;to go somewhere with one’s husband ... after six years. I’m
going to the Fifteen Cent Museum next&mdash;when I get a little farther
along&mdash;some big, noisy, healthy, shabby place. Fred has promised to take
me. He dotes on the gorillas.... Well, I only ran in. The horses are
getting cold. I must go. Give my love to the Doctor&mdash;Helen! I’m going to
church when I get well. I want to hear the <i>Te Deum</i>.... It’s a good
while since I did that. They won’t let me. They put it off till the
last. Fred said I must begin with the Hospital Fair and work up through
the gorillas to re-li-gious dis-si-pa-tion. The Doctor says I’m to get
well in a sci-en-ti-fic manner; on the Law of Ev-o-lution. Poor dear
Doctor! He doesn’t care about the <i>Te Deum</i>.&mdash;Helen, I wish your husband
believed. He is so good&mdash;so kind. He ought to be a re-li-gious man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>sadly, with almost imperceptible bitterness</i>). He is a
doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>{6}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> He is so great, you see. He is almighty to so many miserable
people.... I can understand that. His mind stops there. He is so strong,
so powerful; he works the miracles himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> My husband has no time to study these questions, Mary. All
his life is given up to science, you know. I thought&mdash;when we were first
married&mdash;I could influence him in these ways. But a doctor’s wife learns
better than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> What he needs is to be half-dead. Then he would <i>have</i> to
believe. He is too much alive, poor Doctor.... It is such a joy to be
alive, Helen! I thought I must run in and tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>smiling affectionately</i>). I’ll tell him to be sure and see
you to-morrow. You’ll need it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> Well, Fred can tel-e-phone. I dare say I shall be sick
enough. Good-by, dear&mdash;Helen? What ails <i>you</i>? You don’t look right
to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>{7}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>arousing</i>). Laddie doesn’t seem well at all. I can’t make
Esmerald believe that anything ails him. But that’s the way, you
know.... I am not allowed to be anxious. The mother of a doctor’s child
can never be that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>with quick sympathy</i>). Oh, I am so sorry! I know just how
you feel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> You never had a child, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> But sick people understand everything. Oh, we know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> Yes. I suppose you have so much time to think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> We have so much time to feel. (<i>Rises to leave.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> <i>puts the opera cape over her friend’s shoulders</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>abruptly</i>). Helen, I was thinking to-day about Cleo. I
don’t often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>pityingly</i>). Poor girl! I do, very often. She must have
led a cruel life with her husband. And she was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>{8}</span> young when he died!
She really hated him&mdash;I think as much after he was dead as when he was
alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> She did not hate yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>gravely</i>). She was a patient. I have nothing to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> But of course she hardly made a secret of it, that she loved
the Doctor&mdash;half wrongly, half rightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> Like the woman she was&mdash;half fiend, half angel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). There are people who still talk about her;
they are equally divided whether she died of love or morphine. It is
said she had the opium habit. It is three years ago to-day that she
killed herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> I had forgotten.... Poor Cleo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> I’ve been thinking about her all day&mdash;I don’t know why. She
never liked me very well&mdash;perhaps because I <i>didn’t</i> love the Doctor;
and so he could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a>{9}</span> so much more for me. You know how those things
go.... And you never gave her the satisfaction of one hour’s jealousy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>peacefully</i>). How could I? I never had the materials....
But, as you say, these things are complicated. We never know where the
end of the skein is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> I will send over to-morrow and see how Laddie is.
Good-night&mdash;good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>kisses her warmly</i>). I wish you would stay&mdash;I wish you
need not go. Don’t go! Mary&mdash;<i>don’t go</i>!</p>

<p class="hang">
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>slowly, with a sweet,<br />
mysterious smile</i>).<br />
</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> <i>relapses into her anxious attitude and manner. Moves to
the window, and looks out again, between the curtains. While she stands
there with her back to the door, suddenly and noisily striding in.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span></p>

<p class="c">

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>at once</i>). Isn’t dinner ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>turning delightedly</i>). Oh! At last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Well. You might have met me, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> Why, I have been watching for you&mdash;and listening&mdash;till I’m
half blind and deaf. I have been to the window&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Don’t complain. I hate a complaining woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>has advanced towards him, and impulsively put up her arms!
Drops them at this and turns sadly</i>). I did not know I was complaining,
Esmerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Most people don’t know when they are disagreeable. (<i>He does
not offer to kiss her; pulls off his overcoat nervously.</i>) Isn’t dinner
ready? I am starved out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>ringing</i>). Maggie had orders to put it on as soon as she

<p class="c">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maggie.</span> Dinner is served, Mrs. Thorne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I must run up and change my coat, first&mdash;no, I won’t. I
haven’t time. I am driven to death. Come along, Helen. (<i>Strides out
before her; then recalls himself from his discourtesy, and steps back.</i>
<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>is a tall, well-built, handsome man, of distinguished
bearing, but with a slight limp; his face is disfigured by a frown, as
he looks at his wife. He repeats</i>) I am driven to death! I haven’t time
to call my soul my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>archly</i>). I thought you hadn’t any soul, dear. Or I
thought you thought you hadn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>crossly</i>). Soul? Rubbish! It is more than I can do to
manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>{12}</span> bodies. Soul? Stuff! What have you got for dinner?</p>

<p>(<i>They seat themselves at the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> You poor boy! You poor, tired, hungry fellow! I hope the
dinner will please you? (<i>Timidly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>testily</i>). Really, I hadn’t time to come at all. I’ve got
to go again in ten minutes. But I supposed you would worry if I didn’t
show myself. It’s a foolish waste of time. I wish I hadn’t come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>speaking in a low, controlled, articulate voice</i>). You
need not. On my account. <i>You need never come again.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>irritably</i>). It is easier to come than to know you sit here
making yourself miserable because I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>gently</i>). Have I ever fretted you about coming, Esmerald?
I did not know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> It would be easier if you did fret. I’d rather you’d say a
thing than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span> look it. Any man would.... This soup is burned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> Too bad! I gave special orders to Jane&mdash;that is really too
bad. Let me send it away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). No, I’ve got to get down something. Bring on
the rest&mdash;if there is anything fit to eat. I’m due at the Hospital in
twenty-two minutes. Gazell is behaving like the devil. If I’m not to
handle him, nobody can. The whole staff is afraid of him&mdash;everybody but
me. We sha’n’t get the new ward built these two years if he carries the
day to-night. I’ve got a consultation at Decker’s. The old lady is
dying. It’s no use dragging a tired man out there; I can’t do her any
good. But they will have it. I’m at the beck and call of every whim. I
wish I’d had time to change my boots! My feet are wet. My head aches
horribly. I had an enormous office&mdash;sixty people; forty here&mdash;twenty
down-town&mdash;besides my calls. I’ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a>{14}</span> eighty sick people to-day. I was
a fool to agree to that noon office hour.&mdash;I’ve lost ten thousand
dollars in this panic. Brake telephoned me to get down to Stock Street
to save what I could. I couldn’t get off.... I lost a patient this
morning&mdash;that little girl at the Harrohart’s. She was a poor little
scrofulous thing, but they are terribly cut up about it.&mdash;I wish you’d
had a good, clear soup. I hate these opaque things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> But last time we had consommé, you said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I said! I said! Who cares what he <i>says</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>in a low voice</i>). That seems to be quite true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> What did you say? Do speak louder. I hate to hear women
mumble their words.&mdash;I hope you have some roast beef; better than the
last. You mustn’t let Parsnip cheat you. Quail? There’s no nourishment
in quail for a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a>{15}</span> in my state&mdash; (<i>Pushes away his plate crossly.</i>)
Well, I suppose I’ve got to eat something. I was a fool not to dine at
the club.&mdash;The gas leaks. Can’t you have it attended to? Pudding? No. I
see enough of spoon food in sick rooms. I might have eaten a good,
hearty pie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> But the last pie we had, you said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>again</i>). I said! I said! What does it signify what a man
<i>says</i>? How many times must I say that? Hurry up the coffee. I must
swallow it, and go. I’ve got more than ten men could do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>gently, but with perceptible dignity</i>). It seems to be
more than one woman can do&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> What’s that? Do speak so I can hear you.&mdash;If you’re going to
speak at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> I said it seems to be more than one woman can do to rest
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>carelessly</i>). Do ring for a decent cup of coffee. I can’t
drink this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>{16}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> Esmerald&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>crossly</i>). Oh, what? I can’t stop to talk. There! I’ve
burned my tongue now. If there’s anything I can’t stand, it’s going to a
consultation with a burned tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>tenderly</i>). How tired you are, Esmerald! It even gets into
your poor foot.&mdash;You limp more to-night. I was only going to say that I
am sorry. I can’t <i>let</i> you go without saying that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>rising, and walking irritably through the rooms</i>). I can’t
see that that helps it any. I am so tired I don’t want to be touched.
(<i>Mrs. Thorne brings his overcoat. He repulses her.</i>) Never mind my
coat. I’ll put it on myself. Tell Joe&mdash;No. I left the horse standing; I
don’t want Joe. I suppose Donna is uneasy by this time. She won’t stand
at night&mdash;<i>She’s got to.</i> I’ll get that whim out of her.&mdash;Now don’t look
that way! The horse is safe enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>{17}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne.</span> I haven’t bothered you about the horse, have I? But I don’t
feel&mdash;quite&mdash;easy. She is such a nervous creature, and so&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>imperiously</i>). Don’t you suppose I know how to drive?
You’re always having opinions of your own against mine. There! I must be
off.&mdash;Where’s the boy, Helen? Where’s Laddie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>gently</i>). Laddie isn’t just right, somehow, Esmerald. I
hated to bother you, for you never think it’s anything. Molly is with
him. I’ve been a little troubled about him. He has cried all the
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> He cries because you coddle him! It is all nonsense, Helen.
Nothing ails the child. I won’t encourage this sort of thing. I’ll see
him when I come home. I can’t possibly wait&mdash;I am driven to death&mdash;for
every little whim. (<i>Rushes towards the door, but pauses, irresolute.</i>)
I suppose I shall have to go up&mdash;if you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a>{18}</span> got this fixed idea in your
head. I’ll take a look at him on the way out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>more gently; without reproach, but regarding him
steadily</i>). Good-by, Esmerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Oh, bother!&mdash;I can’t stop for fooling, now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thorne</span> (<i>with sudden change of manner, breaks down, and hides her
face in her arms. She weeps quietly</i>). He has always kissed me
good-by&mdash;before&mdash;ever since we have been married. He never, never missed
before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Helen, I must have an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>{19}</span> to this nonsense! Nothing ails
Laddie. He is only a trifle feverish, with a little toothache&mdash;possibly
there’s a slight cold. The child should be out of the nursery. He will
sleep better for the change. Let him stay awhile&mdash;and don’t make a fool
of yourself over him. It really is very unpleasant to me that you make
such a fuss every time he is ailing. If you had married a green grocer,
it might have been pardonable. Pray remember that you have married a
physician who understands his business, and do leave me to manage it....
There! (<i>Consults his watch.</i>) I’m eight minutes behindhand already, all
for this senseless anxiety of yours. It’s a pity you can’t trust me,

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A dwelling street in the city, seen in an almost deserted
condition. The time is early evening. The wreck
of a buggy lies crushed against a curbstone; the traces
are broken, the horse having released herself and disappeared.
The wreck lies in shadow, and the prostrate
form of a man is but dimly discerned. After a
few moments of suspense and silence, slowly crawling
to his feet,</p></div>

<p><i>Arises</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span>. (<i>He is dressed
for driving, as when he left home; his overcoat
disarranged, muddy, and torn; his hat
gone; his face has a singular pallor, and
his whole appearance is agitated. As he
rises, he throws a carriage robe back over
the spot where he had been lying. He
speaks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> That dastardly brute has
done it, now! I’ll sell Donna for this.&mdash;It
will play the mischief with that old
injury. I shall exchange an interesting
limp for crutches, now.&mdash;Hil-loa! (<i>Walks
to and fro with perfect ease.</i>) The shock
has acted like a battery on the nerve centres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>{22}</span>
Instead of a broken neck I have a cured leg.
I’m a lucky fellow&mdash;as usual. (<i>Laughs
lightly; turns to examine the condition of
the ruined buggy; suddenly looks confused,
and puts his hand to his head.</i>) Curious
cerebral symptoms I have! Queer, there isn’t
a crowd round. They must have missed the
trail when Donna bolted. She’ll be at the
stable by this time.&mdash;She won’t go home.
Helen won’t know.... I shouldn’t like to
be the man that had to tell Helen!... I
must get to her&mdash;I must get home as soon
as I’ve been to the Hospital. I’m afraid I
was a little short with Helen. I wish&mdash; (<i>Presses
both hands to his temples as if to
command himself; looks more and more
bewildered.</i>) I must have been pretty well
stunned&mdash;seems to me there was a collision.
I ran down somebody. It was a landau&mdash;we
crashed&mdash;I saw it overturn&mdash;there
were people in it I knew&mdash;patients....
Who?... <i>Who?</i> (<i>Stamps the pavement
peremptorily, and impatiently strikes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a>{23}</span>
own head.</i>) Who was it?&mdash;Horrible! The
brain cells do not obey me&mdash;<i>me!</i> (<i>Walks
about frenziedly.</i>) ... Ach&mdash;ch! It is
worse to remember than to forget. I have
it now&mdash;the sweetest woman of them all&mdash;Helen’s
friend&mdash;the gentlest, the most obedient,
most trustful, the bravest patient I ever
had&mdash;Mrs. Fayth. I saw her face as the carriage
went over.... She stretched out her
hands, and said: “Doctor!” It was Mary
Fayth. (<i>His face falls into his hands.
For a moment he sinks down on the wreck of
the buggy; but springs up.</i>) Now that accounts
for it.&mdash;The crowd are all there. The
accident was so bad nobody has thought of
me. <i>She</i> is the victim. <i>I</i> have escaped.
Dead or alive, she is done for. She never
could recover from a shock like that. I
must go and find her. I must find Mrs.
Fayth. (<i>Starts and hurriedly walks down
the street, peering everywhere.</i>)</p>

<p>Strange! How strange! I cannot find her. I cannot find anything&mdash;nor
anybody that a man would naturally meet under such circumstances. Not a
trace of the accident&mdash;yet I’m <i>as sure of it as I am that I’m alive</i>.
(<i>Pronounces these words slowly, and paces the sidewalk, irresolute.</i>)
It all came from my being overdue at the Hospital. I suppose I did drive
Donna pretty fast. I wonder if I struck her? I am always in such an
infernal hurry&mdash;I never have had time to live. <i>I am driven to death.</i>
(<i>He says the last five words, not impatiently, but with a certain
solemn deliberation.</i>) I must go at once to Mrs. Fayth’s house. They
must have carried Mary there&mdash;I wish I could spare time to see
Helen!&mdash;I’ll go right home as soon as I’ve been to Fayth’s. Odd! How
these brain symptoms last. I must have had quite a blow. I don’t&mdash;I
can’t&mdash;it is mortifying to feel so confused.</p>

is seen in the consulting room; the door is closed into
the reception room. One gas-jet burns over the desk;
patient’s chair and physician’s chair are seen in the
usual places; the desk is in order for the night; a
movable telephone, of the kind in use in offices, stands
upon the desk.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>throws himself heavily

in the name of all the laws of Nature
cannot I get home? (<i>After a pause, brokenly.</i>)
Well&mdash;well! It’s something to
be here; to get out of the street&mdash;in out
of the night&mdash;it’s a good deal. I’d begun
to understand how outcasts feel&mdash;felons,
apparitions, fugitives. In the name of the
laws of mystery, thank Heaven for so much!
(<i>The light brightens. It reveals his face,
which is haggard and pinched. He pushes
his case books about, aimlessly. Suddenly
his hand hits the receiver of the telephone.

The telephone! I must have gone stark
mad not to think of it.&mdash;See! I’m not a
drinking man, am I? (<i>Puts his hand to
his head.</i>) No. I do not drink. Helen
would not like to have me.&mdash;No. And
I’ve been all these hours without telephoning
to Helen. She’ll think I did it on purpose&mdash;poor
Helen&mdash;because of the words
I said. <i>If a man could slay the words he
says....</i> They harry me&mdash;like ghosts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a>{32}</span>

48.4&mdash;48.4, I say. Why don’t you give
me 48.4? I tell you I’m in a hurry. 48.4!
And be quick with it! (<i>Rings again.</i>) Why
in&mdash;why don’t you attend to your business
there? It is Dr. Thorne&mdash;Dr. Esmerald
Thorne. My errand is most urgent. Give
me my home, and make short work of it.

was not for an unaccountably long time. His watch had stopped at five
minutes past seven o’clock. He was not immediately identified. By some
unpardonable blunder the body of the distinguished and favorite
physician was taken to the morgue.”</p>

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A small ward&mdash;the women’s ward&mdash;in a hospital;
several cots with patients in them are visible. One
patient is in a wheeled chair. Screens stand by the
cots. There are plants, pictures, the cheerful features
of the modern hospital. Two nurses are seen busy
with patients.</p></div>

<p class="c">

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> (<i>seats himself by one of the patients; speaks blandly</i>). And
how do we find ourselves to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient</span> (<i>turning her face, on which can be seen traces of tears</i>). Bad
enough&mdash;worse. I’ve been so upset by&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span>. Yes, yes. I know. It is truly shocking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver</span> (<i>addressing one of the nurses</i>). You become your cap to-day.
You<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44"></a>{44}</span> have an uncommonly good color&mdash;I mean to operate on No. 21.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Do you really? We thought her improving. She’s nervous to-day&mdash;on
account of Dr. Thorne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver.</span> Yes. Thorne had things all his own way here, as usual. I
mean to operate,&mdash;if Dr. Gazell can manage her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse</span> (<i>coquettishly</i>). You are so expert,&mdash;such an easy surgeon. You
don’t mind it more than a layman would carving a Christmas <i>goo</i>&mdash;oose.
And what would you operate for&mdash;on No. 21?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver.</span> Appendicitis, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Really? You are so clever on diagnosis. Now, I hadn’t thought of
appendicitis&mdash;in her case. Do you know&mdash;I thought it more like pleurisy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver</span> (<i>looks keenly at the nurse to discover if she is making game
of him; speaks pompously</i>). The nurse, as you have been taught in your
training-school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45"></a>{45}</span> can have no opinions. Now, the physician&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse</span> (<i>demurely</i>). Oh, of course. I wouldn’t have you think I’m
presuming to set up mine. She might have measles, or the grippe, for
anything <i>I</i> should know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver.</span> Now you speak very properly indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> (<i>at bedside of No. 21</i>). Is the pain more severe on the
right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient.</span> I didn’t say I had any pain&mdash;now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> (<i>soothingly</i>). Increasing toward night? Paroxysms? Or is it
steady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient.</span> I said I’d got over the pain. That has all gone. It is the
weakness&mdash;the deadly weakness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell.</span> Just so. That weakness is a most significant symptom&mdash;I
think you said it was accompanied by nausea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient.</span> No, I didn’t. Not a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell.</span> Just so. Dr. Carver? Here a moment? (<i>To the patient.</i>) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a>{46}</span>I’m
sure we can relieve all that. Just a little operation&mdash;a very pretty
little operation&mdash;would set you right again in a week or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver</span> (<i>coming to the cotside of No. 21; speaks eagerly</i>). It is
such a beautiful operation! Why, I’ve known patients <i>beg</i> for it,&mdash;it
is so beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient</span> (<i>beginning to cry</i>). Dr. Thorne said there was no need of
anything of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> (<i>stiffening</i>). Dr. Thorne was an able man&mdash;but eccentric.
His professional colleagues did not always agree with him.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient No. 21.</span> Dr. Thorne used to say that if we had better doctors, we
shouldn’t need so many surgeons. He said the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>{47}</span> treatment would
prevent half the surgery in the city.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>starts, and moves towards the patient</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> (<i>soothingly</i>). Yes. Just so. Dr. Thorne had great confidence
in himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient</span> (<i>rousing</i>). No more than his patients had in him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Carver.</span> Irritable! Very irritable! A significant symptom, Dr.
Gazell. In my opinion, this extreme irritability <i>demands</i> an operation
for appendicitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Nurse</span> (<i>listening, laughs; addresses</i> <span class="smcap">Second Nurse</span>). Now, if one
could only apply that! Take a cross man,&mdash;any cross man,&mdash;say a brother,
or a husband, or even a doctor, and if he carried it too far, just call
on Dr. Carver. Why, it would revolutionize society. And he is so expert!
He doesn’t mind it any more than carving a <i>goo</i>&mdash;oose. Yes, sir! I’m
coming. (<i>Demurely obedient; hurries to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>smiles bitterly; stands with his face towards the speaker.
He knots his hands in front of him, and thus advances with a motion so
slow as to be almost stealthy.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice from another cot.</span> He wouldn’t care so much for that. It’s Bible.
He was not a religious man. But he was as <i>kind to me</i>! (<i>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other voices.</span> And to me! Oh, yes, and to me,&mdash;as <i>kind</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient in the wheeled chair.</span> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a>{49}</span> couldn’t move in my bed when I came

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>in a low tone</i>). Miss Jessie? Don’t cry so. You’ll make
yourself worse. Go back to bed, Jessie, and&mdash;see. I’ll tell you a
secret. Don’t tell the others just yet. I wasn’t killed, Jessie. That
was a newspaper canard. <i>I’m a live man yet.</i> See! Look up, Jessie. Look

<p><span class="smcap">Patient in the wheeled chair</span> (<i>stares past him at</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Gazell</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.

become of this hospital without <i>him</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>with trembling lip</i>). You don’t hear me, do you, Jessie?
Well&mdash;well. I must have met with some cerebral shock affecting the
organs of speech. It is a clear case of aphasia. I can’t make myself
understood. It&mdash;it’s hard. Jessie? (<i>Louder.</i>) I can’t see things go

<p><span class="smcap">Patient</span> (<i>with tears</i>). I’ve cried half the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient</span> (<i>looks up wearily; turns her face on her pillow and sobs</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is night on a street in the West End of the city.
At the right stands a church, dimly lighted for a choir
to practice. An anthem on the organ can be heard.
At the left appears Dr. Thorne’s house, viewed from
the outside. It has high stone steps, and lights are
in the window. One window on the ground floor has
the curtain raised. The interior of the library can be
seen through the window,&mdash;glimpses of the books, the
pictures, the table, the lamp with the white lace shade.

been anything, or felt anything that was fit to <i>last</i>, I have loved one
woman, and her only&mdash;and thought high thoughts for her, and felt great
emotions for her, and I could forget myself for her sake&mdash;and I would
have had joy to suffer for her, and I’ve been a better man for love of
her. And I have loved her,&mdash;oh, I have so loved her that ten thousand
deaths could not murder that living love! (<i>Falters.</i>) And I spoke to
her&mdash;I said to her&mdash;like any low and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a>{58}</span> brutal fellow, any common
wife-tormentor&mdash;I went from her dear presence to <i>this</i>. (<i>Brokenly.</i>)

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I wonder what is to be done with me next? I see no
particular reason for climbing these mountains. There seems to be
nothing for a dead man to do but to obey orders. Well (<i>candidly</i>), I’ve
given my share of them in my time. I suppose it’s fair enough to turn
about and take a few&mdash;now. (<i>He smiles. After a pause, climbing
slowly.</i>) I must say I can’t call this an attractive country&mdash;so far.
Its main features are not genial.</p>

<p>(<i>The storm increases; there is thunder and cloud.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>looking about</i>). It seems to be in the cyclonic belt.
There’s a storm of some sort,&mdash;I should say two of them fighting up in
these hills. Hear them close<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a>{66}</span> and clinch! Like a man’s two natures;
civil war all the time. And no truce! (<i>Muses.</i>) It’s not a social
region, certainly. I don’t know that I recall, really, ever being in a
place that was so desolate. There isn’t so much as a wild animal, nor a
bird flying over. It reminds me of&mdash;what was it? I can’t recall the
words. It seems to me my mother taught them to me when I was a little
lad. But they have quite gone. Beautiful literature in that old Book!
It’s a good while since I’ve dipped into it. I’ve had too much to do.
What was it?</p>

<p>This is really growing serious. I wish I could remember those words. Now
I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a>{67}</span> of it, we were on our knees. A most unnatural posture! My

<h2><a name="ACT_III" id="ACT_III"></a>ACT III.</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Paradise</i>: A beautiful country. Trees, flowers,
shrubs, vines of great luxuriance abound. Brilliant
birds of unfamiliar plumage can be heard singing in
the boughs. They dip, blazing, through the air. The
grass is bright, and like short fur in effect. The
sheen of water, like the surface of a lake or sea, glimmers
beyond. Sails of faint, fair tints, move and
melt upon the sea. At a distance, upon a hill, are
outlines of graceful architecture. A narrow brook
can be seen, with strange shells upon its little banks.
There are no highways visible. Foot-worn walks and
paths, trodden through the grass, intersperse the
landscape. The grass, however, springs afresh beneath
the foot, and is not crushed or sear. Annunciation
lilies and scarlet passion-flowers grow in the
foreground. Bluebells, in clusters, spring beyond.
Roses are many. Flowers unknown to the botanies
of earth are frequent; and among those to which we
are used, it will be noticed that the blossoms of the
tropics and of the North countries flourish side by
side. The whole impression is one of delight and
beauty. The sky has a misty softness, and the atmosphere
is capable of taking on (and takes on) sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a>{78}</span>
and subtle changes of effect. It is now seen to be
early morning, and all the tints of the landscape are
tender and fresh.</p>

<p>The scene is populous with <i>bright beings</i>. These
are seen to differ from the people of this planet chiefly
in their joyousness of manner, and in a certain high
expression, of which it might be said, in a word, that
the absence of low motive, and the presence of a sense
of ease and security, are the predominant features.
These beings wear flowing robes of various tints&mdash;dove,
rose, blue, corn, violet, silver, gold, and pearl.
Here and there one appears garbed in the color of the
pale leaf, and, in moving among the foliage, seems
to have sprung from it. Many spirits are clothed in
shining white. Happy conversation and gentle laughter
can be heard.</p></div>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter</i> Two Children. <i>These play in the<br />
brook, and gather the shells. They are<br />
robed in short, childish garments&mdash;a<br />
little frock, a little dress, both white,<br />
and each clasped by a small, golden<br />
cross.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child</span> (<i>a boy, four or five years old</i>). I never saw such pretty
shells in that other place we lived. They took me to the seaside
summers, but there weren’t any there that began to be so pretty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a>{79}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child</span> (<i>a girl</i>). <i>I</i> never played with <i>any</i> shells before. We
lived in a street. It was dark and dirty. I never saw the sea till I
came here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child.</span> I never saw you in that other place, did I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child.</span> No. You wouldn’t have played with me there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child.</span> I like you here&mdash;don’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child.</span> And I like you. I like you best of anybody I’ve seen in
this pretty country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child.</span> Do you like roses? Or don’t you care for anything but
shells?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child</span> (<i>adoringly</i>). I like roses, if you like roses.</p>

<p>(<i>They leave the brook, and gather roses, pelting each other with them,
and laughing merrily.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">First Child</span> <i>tosses a rose over the brook</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Second Child</span> <i>picks a bluebell, and puts it to her lips</i>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a>{80}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child.</span> No. They’re not to eat. They’re to listen to. See! I’ll
ring mine. Hark! (<i>He rings the bluebell. It gives out a musical
tintinnabulation.</i>) Now, you hark again. I never heard a bluebell ring
in that other place, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child.</span> I never saw one on our street.... Oh, <i>mine</i> rings,
too!... Say! Are these angels? I never saw an angel either, in our
street.</p>

<p>(The Children <i>wander away and mingle with the groups of spirits. They
ring the bluebells as they go. The tintinnabulation is drowned in
orchestral music, which can be heard from a distance. The theme is from
Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. Certain of the spirits listen attentively,
and move towards the music. Certain others continue to talk happily, and
stir among the trees.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span>. (<i>Walks slowly and<br />
alone. He is robed still in purple,<br />
with a tunic of white showing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>{81}</span><br />
throat. He looks pallid and harassed.<br />
He stands for a time apart,<br />
keenly observant of the scene and of<br />
the people, then sinks in thought. He<br />
speaks.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Children here, too?</p>

<p>(<i>He looks wistfully at the two children, who are playing together at a
distance from him. He picks up the rose which the little boy had tossed
over the brook; puts it to his face; speaks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> What a perfume the flowers have in this country! This seems
to be a rose, yet it is not a rose. You might call it the soul of a
rose. Exquisite, whatever it is. Some one has dropped this one. There is
personality clinging to it. Curious! It is as though I clasped a little
hand when I touch it.</p>

<p>(<i>He sighs; walks to and fro thoughtfully; does not throw away the rose,
but cherishes it. Groups of spirits pass and repass. Some of them smile
at him kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a>{82}</span> but he does not return the smile. No one addresses
him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I have done my share of traveling in my day, but I must say
I never was in a land that seems to me so foreign as this. Nothing looks
natural. I seem to have no acquaintances. Apparently nobody knows me. I
have no introductions. I am afraid I have got here without letters of
credit. (<i>Breaks off.</i>) That was a mistake. I never did such an ignorant
thing before. I must say it is an attractive country, too. Everything
shows a high degree of civilization, and the beauty of the place is
unsurpassed. But it does not appeal to me. (<i>He shakes his head.</i>) ... I
am too homesick.... If Helen were here, I could enjoy it.</p>

<p>(<i>He strolls about without aim or interest. Happy spirits pass and
repass.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter a man-spirit of impressive and<br />
commanding appearance. His costume<br />
bears a certain vague resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a>{83}</span><br />
to the dress of a gentleman and scholar<br />
of the Court of Charles I. of England.<br />
A cloak of the tint of the dead<br />

by a golden cross. He regards</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.<br />
Thorne</span> <i>with a piercing but kindly<br />
look. He speaks with a fine and<br />
courtly manner, dating from a bygone<br />
age.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man-Spirit.</span> I read thee for a stranger here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>bitterly</i>). A stranger in a strange place am I, indeed. You
are the first inhabitant of this country who has troubled himself to
speak to me. Thank you for your politeness, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man-Spirit.</span> I was commanded. These (<i>waving his hand toward the
groups of spirits</i>) were not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> You look like a person more fitted to give commands than to
receive them. I fail to understand that word&mdash;<i>commanded</i>. I am&mdash;at
least, I was&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a>{84}</span>a sovereign citizen of America. I was not born or trained
a subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man-Spirit</span> (<i>smiling</i>). And I was subject of an English
sovereign&mdash;in fact, an officer of the royal court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>without smiling</i>). And this nation? Is it an autocratic
monarchy you have here? What <i>is</i> your political system?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man-Spirit.</span> It is a simple one&mdash;a pure theocracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>indifferently</i>). Oh, theocracy? That is a system into which
I have never studied. I have been a busy man. I was a
physician&mdash; (<i>Abruptly.</i>) Would you favor me with your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man-Spirit.</span> I was a healer of the sick in my time. My name
was&mdash; (<i>Whispers his name.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>starts with pleased surprise</i>). The great <i>Harvey</i>? And
<i>you</i> discovered the circulation of the blood? How wonderful! Why, I
thought you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a>{85}</span> been mould and clover these two hundred and fifty
years! It never occurred to me that you were alive.... What an
extraordinary fact!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey</span> (<i>turns away wearily</i>). I did not think to find your education so
limited. I understood you to be a man of superior powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>humbly</i>). Don’t leave me, Doctor Harvey! I am the most
unhappy man in this most happy country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey</span> (<i>slowly</i>). Then you did not bring with you the materials of
happiness. What had you? What <i>were</i> your possessions in the life
yonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>solemnly, but still bitterly</i>). Love, happiness, home,
health, prosperity, fame, wealth, ambition. None of them did I bring
with me. I have lost them all upon the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> Was there by chance nothing else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Nothing more, unless you count a little incidental
usefulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a>{86}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> Plainly, you are not in a normal condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>hastily</i>). I am perfectly well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> You are sick of soul. You are not in health of spirit. You are
out of harmony with your atmosphere. Do you wish me to take the case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Take the case, Doctor Harvey. Cure me of my nostalgia. Show
me how to become a citizen of this foreign land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> You know what it means to be a patient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>grimly</i>). I can think of no worse fate; but I’ll make the
best of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey</span> (<i>smiling kindly</i>). I will undertake the case. At evening inquire
your way to my dwelling. (<i>Moves away; returns; hesitates; lingers;
speaks impulsively.</i>) Concerning the latest attainments in science on
the planet Earth&mdash;they have the keenest interest for me. You have so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a>{87}</span>
many advantages&mdash;facilities that we never had. (<i>He sighs wistfully.</i>) I
am told that your therapeutics are really wonderful. And the advances in
surgery? Did you find them as beautiful as they are said to be?</p>

<p class="hang">

<p><span class="smcap">Woman-Spirit.</span> Doctor! Doctor Thorne!</p>

has happened to you? How did you get here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. True.</span> I died yesterday.... I knew I should see you, Doctor.
(<i>Calmly.</i>) I counted on that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>starting back</i>). Did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88"></a>{88}</span>&mdash;you don’t mean to say they
really operated on you? You were convalescent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. True</span> (<i>laughing outright</i>). Yes, in a week after you were killed.
Dr. Carver vivisected guinea-pigs all that week to keep in practice. I
died under the knife.... I wish you’d seen their faces!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). What did they find&mdash;anything to justify the
butchery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. True.</span> Of course not. Didn’t you say there wasn’t?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>gratefully</i>). You always were a loyal patient&mdash;better than
I deserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. True.</span> You always were a kind doctor&mdash;better than I deserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>still gazing steadfastly at</i> The Child). Where is your
mother, my lad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Child.</span> I don’t know. I lost her on the way, somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> And your father? What has become of your father?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a>{95}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Child.</span> Oh, <i>he’s</i> dead. He got dead before I came here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>moves within</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne’s</span> <i>range of vision</i>; <i>speaks
quietly</i>). Good-morning, Doctor. (<i>Smiles brightly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>springs to his feet; cries out</i>). Mary Fayth! I thought you
had forgotten me! I have&mdash;needed you.</p>

<p>(The Child <i>rises; leans up against</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne’s</span> <i>knee confidingly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> I have often needed <i>you</i>, Doctor. And you never failed me
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>impetuously</i>). I thought you would have come before. I
looked for you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> As I have often looked for <i>you</i>. But I was not commanded to
meet you&mdash;till this very minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Commanded? Commanded? There is that singular phrase again.
Have you seen Helen? (<i>Quickly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>shakes her head</i>). Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Have you seen your husband? Did they let <i>you</i> go to
<i>Fred</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96"></a>{96}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>contentedly</i>). Oh, many times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Child</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). He doesn’t kiss me! (<i>Puts up his lips in a
grieved, babyish fashion.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>very quietly</i>). Doctor, don’t hurt that child’s feelings.
He’s yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>gasping</i>). I don’t understand you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth.</span> I have had the care of him since he came here. He’s kept me
busy, I can tell you. I am to give him over to you now.... See how he’s
grown! No wonder you didn’t know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>in great agitation</i>). Did Laddie <i>die</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> (<i>solemnly</i>). Yes, Laddie died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Did something really ail him that night&mdash;that most miserable
night?... Oh, poor Helen! Poor, poor Helen! (<i>His face falls into his
hands. His frame shakes with soundless, tearless sobs.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97"></a>{97}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laddie</span> (<i>creeps into his lap; lays his head on his father’s neck</i>).
Hilloa, Papa! (<i>Pats his father on the cheek.</i>)</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayth</span> <i>silently, with emotion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>raises his head, showing his stormy face. Clasps the child,
hesitatingly at first, then passionately; holds him off at arm’s length;
scans him closely; draws him back; kisses his little hands, then his

little son! (<i>Smiles naturally for the first time since he died; then
with sudden recollection, he cries out.</i>) Oh, what will your poor mother
do without you?</p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dull daylight falls upon a wide and desolate expanse.
This has the appearance of a desert&mdash;unbroken and
arid. The horizon is low and heavy with cloud, and
is defined by a tossing sea-line against which no sail
appears. In the distance are cliffs, fissured by dark
cuts, but these are far away, and the foreground is
flat like sand or ashes, or it might be corrugated like
slag. There is no vegetation visible, and no sign of
organized life.</p></div>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span>. (<i>He paces the sands,
mournfully gazing about him at the
lonely scenery. He murmurs, then
raises his voice rhythmically, like one
who quotes from an uncertain memory.</i>)</p>

<p>Where did I get that? Oh, I remember. I had not thought of it for years.
That woman used to quote it to me. She was the most consistent infidel I
ever knew. She shied at nothing; took the consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99"></a>{99}</span> both living and
dying.... A shocking death, though! I suppose the boy is all right with
Mrs. Fayth and that little chum of his. If it hadn’t been for that
discussion with Harvey I shouldn’t have left him. Wishing seems to be
doing, in this singular state of existence. A man makes a simple
astronomical inquiry about a planet, and forthwith he is in the planet.
Remarkable! (<i>Breaks off; continues.</i>) How magnificent Helen was about
that affair. If she had doubted me&mdash;but she never did. She was superb.</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter an</i> <span class="smcap">Evil Spirit</span>. <i>Her garments<br />
are of flame color. Her hair has the<br />
same tint. On her forehead blazes a<br />
single scarlet star. Her appearance<br />
is queenly and confident. As she reveals<br />
her face, it is seen to be that of<br />
the woman whose wraith has followed</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>at intervals ever since<br />
the hour of his death. Her robe,<br />
which is opaque, reveals her bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>{100}</span><br />
arms and feet, but covers her shoulders<br />
and bosom with a certain modesty,<br />
which is felt at once to be not<br />
wholly natural to the woman. Each<br />
footprint that she makes upon the<br />
sand is marked by a small jet of<br />
flame, which flares after she has<br />
passed, and dies down quickly.</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.<br />
Thorne</span> <i>stares at the woman in evident<br />
and not well-pleased perplexity</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>speaks</i>). So? Am I forgotten on first principles? It is some
years since we had the pleasure of meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>coldly</i>). I begin to recognize you, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo.</span> You did not know it, but I have given you several other
opportunities to do so since you died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I should think that quite possible&mdash;and characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>wincing</i>). Your tongue has not lost its edge! I’m afraid they
have not made a hopeful convert of you in yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span> pious country....
Confess, you’re bored past endurance with the whole thing? (<i>She draws a
little nearer to him, but is so adroit as not to touch him. She gives
him only her eyes, and these embrace him outright.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>regarding her steadily</i>). Did I ever choose <i>you</i> for a
confidante? (<i>He steps back.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>persistently</i>). Come, don’t be cross! Tell me, then, why have you
fled the first circles of celestial society&mdash;to mope out here alone? Oh,
you can’t deceive me. <i>I</i> understand&mdash;I always understood you better
than any other woman living. (<i>In a low tone.</i>) Your whole nature is in
antagonism with the very basis of existence in the state you’re plunged
into. What’s death? Nothing but a footstep. You’ve taken it. But you’re
the man you were.... Pouf! <i>That’s</i> death. (<i>Snaps her fingers.</i>) I’d
wager a waltz and a kiss that you are <i>ennuyé</i> to madness over
there....<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span> Admit it? (<i>Tenderly.</i>) Admit it! (<i>Imperiously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). I don’t profess to be thoroughly acclimated.
But I assure you I did not come here to sulk. On the contrary, I was
absorbingly interested in a scientific discussion with a distinguished
man. It was an astronomical point. I came here to verify it. I return at
once. (<i>Moves away.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo.</span> Don’t be in such a blatant hurry! It’s not polite. (<i>Pouting.</i>)
I’ve studied a little astronomy myself of late.... Come! I can converse
about planets&mdash;if you will. Was it Neptune or Venus you undertook to
investigate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>not without interest</i>). I contended that it was
Neptune&mdash;before I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo.</span> And now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>gloomily gazing at her</i>). I am inclined to think it is
Venus.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Cleo</span> <i>laughs softly</i>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>does not smile</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>abruptly</i>). Esmerald Thorne, do you know what has happened? You
are in an uninhabited world&mdash;with me. You are in a dead world, burnt to
ashes, burnt to slag and lava by its own fires. You are alone in
it&mdash;<i>alone with me.... (In a changed voice.) And I meant you should be.</i>
Oh, I’ve dreamed of this for years. I’ve held my breath for it, perished
for it.... Now, here we are&mdash;we two outcasts from the religious idea&mdash;we
who always rebelled against it, by the very bone and tissue of our
being.... We two (<i>tenderly</i>) <i>alone, at last</i>. (<i>She advances towards
him, and for the first time touches him, gently laying her hand upon his
shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>not rudely, but positively, removes her hand, stepping back
quickly, so that her arm falls heavily by her side</i>). Woman! Woman, what
are you? A spirit damned, or a spirit deluded?... I confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span> I never
knew. And I don’t know any better now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>more modestly lifts his hand to her cheek; speaks gently</i>). Do
you know any better now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>withdrawing his hand</i>). My wife always said you were half
angel, half the other thing. She pitied you, I think. I confess I never
did, very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>wretchedly</i>). I never asked for the pity of Helen Thorne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>firmly</i>). You might well receive it, Madam. It would not
harm you any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Oh, everybody knew you were an irreproachable
husband. A blameless physician, of course. But we have changed all that.
You are quite free now&mdash;as free as I am, for that matter....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>nobly</i>). Yes; I am free, as you say. I am free to mourn my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span>wife, and love her ... and await her presence ... which has a value to
me that I do not ... I cannot discuss&mdash;with <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>rebuffed, but gentle and sad</i>). I beg your pardon, Dr. Thorne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>takes a few steps nearer her</i>). And I yours ... if I have
wronged you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>softly</i>). You feel so sure of her, then? Helen is so attractive!
These spiritual women always are&mdash;up to a certain point.... Life is a
long wait, brutally tedious. You know as well as I do how many&mdash;Now,
there is Dr. Gazell. A very consolable widower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>proudly</i>). Oh, that was a blunt stroke. <i>Gazell?</i> If Gazell
were a dog by which my wife might track her way to me through the
mystery of death ... she might have some use for him ... hardly
otherwise. I gave you credit for some wit, Cleo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo.</span> I own the illustration was defective. But there are a plenty
better. There are gentler men than you. For my part, I don’t mind your
attacks of the devil. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>{106}</span> never did. I’d take your cruelty to have your
tenderness&mdash;any day. But Mrs. Thorne is sensitive to kindness. She likes
the even disposition, the patient, model man. After all, there are a
good many of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>lifting his head</i>). I am not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>turning away</i>). And you? She is a young woman. It may be
years....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>coldly</i>). You will have to excuse me. I left some one.... I
may be missed. I have ties which even you would respect, Madam. I must
return whence I came. (<i>He moves away.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Cleo</span> <i>hides her face in her hands; is heard to weep</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>steps back</i>). Do you want my pity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>murmurs</i>). Alone&mdash;in a desert world&mdash;we two&mdash;at last. Oh, you
don’t know the alphabet of happiness! You have everything to learn ...
from me. And we shall never be like this again!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>frankly</i>). I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>suddenly starting, paces the ashes; throws her arms above her
head</i>). I always said you had a Nero in you.... Oh, I understood
you&mdash;<i>I</i>! But <i>you</i>.... It never occurred to you, I suppose, that you
died on my very day? I had been dead three years that night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>more gently</i>). What did you do it for, Cleo? You know I
warned you about that habit. You know I took the laudanum away from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo.</span> But you could not cork up the Limited Express&mdash;could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> It was a dreadful death! Tell me, how do you fare? Where do
you live? Do you suffer? What is your lot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>with sudden reserve, and not without dignity</i>) We suicides have
our own fate. We bear it. We do not reveal it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Well&mdash;I must bid you good-morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>savagely</i>). At least, I gained something<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span>&mdash;if I lose all. Of
course, it never dawned on you that this was all my scheme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>in dismay</i>). <i>Your scheme?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>past control, raves</i>). Oh, I had watched my chance for years. I
knew <i>you</i>&mdash;your mad moods, your black temper.... Yourself slew
yourself, Esmerald Thorne. Your own weakness gave me my opportunity. I
waited for my moment. I sat in the buggy beside you.... I sometimes did
that when your evil had you. (I couldn’t get there when you were good,
you know.) I tried to take the reins. <i>I tried to get the whip</i>&mdash;I could
not do it. <i>I meant to hit the horse</i>&mdash;my arm was held. (There are
always so many of these holy busybodies about&mdash;angels and messengers of
sanctity&mdash;to interfere with one!) Oh, then I sprang out&mdash;over the wheel
into the street. You didn’t see me, <i>but Donna did</i>. When she shied I
clung to her bit. And then she bolted.... It was a very simple thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>recoiling slowly, an expression of cold horror chills his
features</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>still raving</i>). Yes, I’ve murdered you&mdash;if you will&mdash;and Mary
Fayth besides. And I’ve broken Helen’s heart. Do you suppose that
counts? Who counts? Nobody on earth, or in heaven, or in hell. <i>I’ve got
you away from your wife....</i> And in earth, or in heaven, or in hell,
I’ll have you yet....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>throwing out his hands; holds her off with evidences of
unbearable repulsion; speaks with difficulty</i>). And I pitied you a
moment since. Now I cannot scorn you. It is too fine a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>more calmly</i>). I can abide my time.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Laddie</span>, <i>running rapidly</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laddie.</span> Papa, Papa! Oh, I missed you, Papa!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>starting</i>). I did not know the child was dead! (<i>Looks
disconcerted.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>catches the child, and holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span> him to his heart; speaks</i>).
No. You only knew you left him fatherless. (<i>With much agitation,
continues.</i>) How did you get here, Laddie? How did you find the way?
Papa hadn’t forgotten his little boy. I was coming right back to you, my
son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laddie</span> (<i>mysteriously; looking about</i>). A man with wings brought me. We
flowed over.... He is waiting out there to take us back. (<i>Observing</i>
<span class="smcap">Cleo</span>, <span class="smcap">Laddie</span> <i>slips down to the ground, and backs up against his
father’s knees; points at the woman</i>.) Papa, I don’t like that lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>cruelly</i>). My son, I cannot deny that I respect your taste.
(<i>Clasps the boy to his heart again; then puts him down once more, and,
with a fine motion, holds the child at arm’s-length between himself and
the woman.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleo</span> (<i>averting her face</i>). I perceive the importance of the obstacle. I

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>pointing to the architecture beyond</i>). And those public
buildings yonder&mdash;what do you call them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> Those are our institutions of education and of mercy. They are a
great pleasure to us. We have our temples, colleges, music halls,
libraries, schools of science, hospitals, galleries of art, as a matter
of course. What did you <i>suppose</i> we did with our intellects and our
leisure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I never supposed anything on the subject. I never thought

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey.</span> Precisely. You are very ignorant&mdash;for a man of your gifts. Now,
our hospitals&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> Pray do not mock me, Doctor Harvey. If you <i>had</i> a hospital,
you could find me something to do. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span> humiliating idleness of this
place crushes me. I seem to be of no more use here than a paralytic
patient was in my own charity ward at home. I am become of no more
social importance than the janitor or the steward used to be. I am of no
consequence. I am not in demand. No person desires my services. The
canker of idleness eats upon me. Here, in this world of spirits, I am an
unscientific, useless fellow. If you have anything whatever in the shape
of a hospital, I beg you to find me employment in it. At least, I could
keep the temperature charts, if I am not to be trusted with any cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey</span> (<i>smiling sadly</i>). Your cure proceeds but slowly, my patient. I
did not think you were a <i>dull</i> man. Must you be taught the elements?

<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the same perspective as Scene III. is the Heavenly
City on the Hill. Thronging spirits move to
and fro.</p>

<p>The distance is full of radiance and of happy social
life. In the foreground is seen a dim and desolate
place. It is cavernous and mountainous. Its extreme
edge yawns over a black space, like a gulf or pit, or
it might be the mouth of an underground river. Here
and there is a stark, dead tree. A narrow footpath
winds among the crags. The path turns a sharp
corner between boulders; and the fair contrast of a
sunny country smiles beyond it. Rosebushes in full
bloom peer above the top of the rocks. The annunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>{136}</span>
lily is still prominent among the flowers. No
sign of life appears in the mountainous foreground.</p>

<p>Suddenly, silently, and swiftly, moving from the
sunny land, around the sharp turn in the pathway,
feet and face set toward the cavernous region,</p></div>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Azrael</span>, <i>Angel of Death</i>. (<i>The<br />
Angel is immovable of manner. But<br />
an obvious tenderness wars with the<br />
solemnity of his expression. He looks<br />
neither to the right nor to the left, but<br />
glides over the rough path steadily;<br />
his robe, which is of dull, white gauze,<br />
conceals his feet; his wings are<br />
folded; he carries no flaming sword,<br />
nor any weapon.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>(<i>After a moment’s interval, following</i> <span class="smcap">The Angel</span> <i>quickly</i>,)</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>his robe is much<br />
paler, but still of a purplish tint. It<br />
is now clasped by the golden cross.<br />
He cries aloud</i>). Azrael!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Echo</span> (<i>from the caverns</i>). Azrael!</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Azrael</span> <i>makes no reply. Moves on steadily.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>{137}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>in a lower voice</i>). Azrael, Angel of Death!</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Azrael</span> <i>turns his head, but without pausing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> In the name of Him who strove with thee, and conquered
thee&mdash;whither goest thou, Azrael?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Azrael</span> <i>pauses. He looks over his folded wing at the man; regards him
steadily; does not speak; moves on again.</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>utters an
inarticulate exclamation. He follows the Angel. Halfway down the path he
stops, perplexed. His expression is anxious.</i> <span class="smcap">Azrael</span> <i>moves on. He does
not again look back; glides to the edge of the ravine. The scene
darkens. The Angel does not pause, but can be seen to cross the gulf
fleetly. He does not fly, but appears to tread the air across the
space.</i>)</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>Vanish</i> <span class="smcap">Azrael</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>stands alone in the gloom. His eyes are fixed upon the spot
where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>{138}</span> Angel disappeared. A low, rushing sound, as of water, can now
be heard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>shudders; speaks</i>). It seems like an underground river.
Horrible! (<i>Calls.</i>) Azrael! Tell me thine errand&mdash;in this fearful
place!</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Azrael</span> <i>neither replies nor appears. It grows very dark. The
perspective of the Heavenly City fades. The rushing of the river can be
heard. Now, through the unearthly gloom, upon the hither side of the
gulf, slowly grow to form the outlines of a Woman. She stretches her
arms out with the motion of one feeling her way. She moves with
difficulty, tripping sometimes, but regaining her footing bravely. Her
robe is light. Her face cannot be recognized.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>on whose sensitive countenance falls the only light in the
scene, shows an unaccountable emotion. He murmurs</i>). It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>{139}</span>woman&mdash;alone&mdash;exhausted ... and a stranger. As I serve her, so may God
send some soul of fire and snow to serve my dear wife&mdash;in <i>her</i> hour of
mortal need! (<i>He advances towards the woman with a chivalrous
sympathy.</i>)</p>

<p>(The Woman <i>moves on steadily; weakens; reels, but holds her ground. It
can now be seen that her eyes are closed. She falls. She does not cry
out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> How brave you are! Keep courage. (<i>Catches her before she
touches the ground. She lies in his arms in a faint or collapse.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>carries her along midway of the scene</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>It lightens slowly. As it does so, it can be seen that the woman is
young and fair, and fine of nature. Her robe is of dazzling white; it
has a surface like that of satin-finished gauze, which reflects all the
light there is. Her long, dark hair is disordered, and falls about her.
She is pale. Her eyes do not open. She lies helplessly in his arms.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>{140}</span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>lays her gently against the trunk of a dead tree, which has
fallen across a hollow in the cliff, and which rests so as to support
the woman. He seats himself beside her; bends to examine her face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>recognizes the face of the woman; cries in a voice that
rings through the hills</i>). <i>Helen!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Echo</span> (<i>takes up the cry</i>). <i>Helen!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> (<i>is half-conscious and confused; does not open her eyes;
murmurs</i>). Will it last long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>clasps her reverently. As his arms touch her, they can be
seen to tremble. He moans</i>). My&mdash;poor&mdash;wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> (<i>still lying with closed eyes; murmurs, but more
distinctly</i>). I said I would die two deaths for him.... Are they over,
yet?... if that would help him any ... where he had gone. (<i>Opens her
eyes, but they see nothing. Dreamily and solemnly, as if repeating a
familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>{141}</span> prayer, she speaks softly.</i>) Great God! I will die ten deaths
for him ... and count myself a happy woman ... if that will make it any
easier for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>groaning, puts his wife gently from him, as if she were a
being too sacred for his touch. Turns his face from her; speaks</i>). I am
not fit!... I dare not touch her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> (<i>praying</i>). Dear Lord! I would die for him ... as Thou
didst die for us.... If that could be.... <i>Dear</i> Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> (<i>utterly broken</i>). I am a sinful man, O God! (<i>Removes from
her, and stands with his face in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> (<i>recovering full consciousness, and with it sudden
strength, lifts herself to a sitting posture; looks about her; half
rises. Suddenly she recognizes her husband, where he stands aloof. She
cries plaintively</i>). Esmerald?&mdash;Isn’t it over yet? <i>Esmerald!</i> Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>{142}</span> you
forgotten me? Don’t you <i>care</i> for me any more?... (<i>piteously</i>). Oh,
Death! I did not think that thou wouldst <i>crucify</i> me ... <i>so</i>!</p>

<p>(<i>Sudden darkness falls. When it passes, the gulf, the dark mountain,
the underground river, the ravines are gone. Slow and sweet light
returns softly. It is the setting of the sun. The perspective of the
Heavenly City and spirits are as before. The grim scenery surrounding
the mouth of the River of Death has given place to a fair meadow, sunny
and open. Some of the boulders remain, and the path which cut through
the ravine now runs across the field. Clumps of trees and thick shrubs
break the space between the foreground and the distant spirits, and the
path turns a curve through a thicket of roses. Lilies as before grow
higher than any other flowers, and nearer to the eye.</i>)</p>

her pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>{143}</span> face. Her expression is radiant. She looks downward and

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>resists her still, and, fallen at her feet, he draws the
hem of her robe slowly to his lips. Then he lays his cheek upon her feet
before he reverently kisses them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne.</span> I said ... oh, I have broken my heart for what I said ... to
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> (<i>reaches down her beautiful arms to him. Draws him up</i>).
Why, my poor Love! My dear Love! Did you think I would remember <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span> <i>arises. Holds out his shaking arms; does not speak.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Helen Thorne</span> <i>in silence creeps to him, not royally, like a wife who
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>{144}</span> wronged; but like the sweetest woman in the world, who loves him
because she cannot help it, and would not if she could. Her face falls
upon his breast.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dr. Thorne</span>, <i>as if she were a goddess, still not daring to caress her,

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
